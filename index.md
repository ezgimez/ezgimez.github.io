Hi, I am Ezgi. I am a **PhD candidate in
Electrical and Computer Engineering** at *New York University* where I'm advised by [Elza Erkip](https://wp.nyu.edu/elza_erkip/). I hold an (integrated) MEng degree in Electrical Electronics Engineering from *Imperial College London*. My recent collaborators include [Jona Ballé](https://balle.io/) and [Aaron B. Wagner](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/aaron-b-wagner) in academia, and [Zhiqi Chen](https://zhiqiiiiiii.github.io/), [Kedar Tatwawadi](https://kedartatwawadi.github.io/) and [Oren Rippel](https://www.orenrippel.com/) from Apple.

I’m a collaborative researcher who enjoys working across diverse teams. My PhD work focuses on bridging theory and practice in data compression by drawing on tools from **deep/machine learning**, **signal processing**, and **information theory**. More recently, I’ve also begun working on **perceptual optimization** and **3D vision**.

 *I am always happy to chat on topics at the intersection of information theory, deep/machine learning and data compression* -- feel free to drop me an email at *me(at)ezgi(dot)space*.

## Recent Updates

* July 2025: My PhD research was featured on [NYU Tandon's website](https://engineering.nyu.edu/news/meet-graduate-student-ezgi-ozyilkan)! Many thanks to [Mari Rich](https://engineering.nyu.edu/staff/mari-rich) for the fun interview.

* May 2025: Excited to be joining **Apple** as an *ML + Video Research Intern* this summer in Cupertino! Relocated to San Francisco/Bay Area for the summer.

 * March 2025: Honored to be selected as an [iREDEFINE 2025 Fellow](https://www.ecedha.org/Meetings/2025-ECEDHA-Annual-Conference-and-ECExpo/iREDEFINE) by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Heads Association [(ECEDHA)](https://www.ecedha.org/)! Here is the [poster](/assets/Ozyilkan_iREDEFINE-poster_March2025.pdf) I presented.

* February 2025: Gave an *invited talk* at the [High-Beams Seminar](https://complightlab.com/outreach/), where I discussed my recent work on learning-based distributed (data) compression. Many thanks to [Kaan Aksit](https://kaanaksit.com/) for the kind invitation!

* January 2025: Our workshop proposal titled *"Learn to Compress and Compress to Learn"* for [2025 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory](https://2025.ieee-isit.org/) has been accepted! Check out our workshop website [here](https://learn-to-compress-workshop-isit.github.io/).

* December 2024: Honored to be selected as a recipient of the 2024 [IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS)](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/) [Scholarship](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/gallery/2024-sps-scholarship-recipients)!

* November 2024: In our recent [NeurIPS'24 workshop paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=qcM1fkFj3Y), we discuss a few overarching *failure modes* of some popular class of neural compressors -- that is, their difficulty in learning discontinuous functions.
