Hi, I am Ezgi. I am a **PhD candidate in
Electrical and Computer Engineering** at *New York University* where I'm advised by [Elza Erkip](https://wp.nyu.edu/elza_erkip/). I hold an (integrated) MEng degree in Electrical Electronics Engineering from *Imperial College London*. Recent collaborators include [Jona Ballé](https://balle.io/) and [Aaron B. Wagner](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/aaron-b-wagner) and [Deniz Gündüz](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/d.gunduz). 

I am a collaborative researcher and enjoy working with people from diverse backgrounds. My current research is driven by a passion for **connecting theory and practice** in data compression and communication problems, particularly in distributed scenarios. I leverage tools from **learning, signal processing, compression and information theory**, yielding interpretable results.

 *I am always happy to chat and am open to give invited talks on topics at the intersection of information theory, "deep"/machine learning and data compression* -- feel free to drop me an email at *ezgi(dot)ozyilkan(at)nyu(dot)edu*!
