Hi, I am Ezgi (she/they). I am a second year **PhD candidate in
Electrical Engineering** at *New York University* under the advisory of
Professor Elza Erkip, [CommIT Group at NYU](https://wp.nyu.edu/elza_erkip/). I
received my (integrated) MEng degree in Electrical Engineering from *Imperial College London* in 2021.

My current interests are in *learned (distributed) compression models* and multi-terminal source coding. My background is in *(information-theoretic) deep learning* and *statistical signal processing*. Outside of academia, I hike as well as try to expand my food and coffee palate.

I am always happy to chat about topics at the intersection of information theory and deep learning -- feel free to drop me an email at *ezgi(dot)ozyilkan(at)nyu(dot)edu*!
